Norris is a powerful and easy-to-use framework that allows a developer to generate and run an instance where he can create several types of charts and arrange them in different pages.
The charts and pages can be accessed by clients through either a browser-based or an Android application, and the chart properties and data can be updated at any moment; each of the clients connected will receive the update in real time without any further effort needed.

In order to use it, you need to install it from the npm platform with the following instruction:
```
npm install norris-nrti
```
